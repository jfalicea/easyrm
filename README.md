# Vendor Management Program  

### Goals
**Objective 1** 
Provide an easy to use application for managing a Company's vendor.   

The application will have four modules: 
1. Add Vendor and associate products with vendors 
2. Risk Assessment Vendors 
3. Perform Vendor Due Diligence 
4. Reports 

**Objective 2**
Document the my development process within the README.  

### Application Design Process 

Step 1: **Design Process**
As a new developer, I had to fight my instincts to jump right into code.  With that being said, I utilized Balsamiq to assist with mocking up how the application should look and feel.  
### Dev Dependencies 
* To open the .bmpr file extension you need Balsamiq Mockups 3 
* Code is written utilizing Visual Studio Code
